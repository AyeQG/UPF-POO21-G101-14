Q1. What do you see on the command screen?
A1. We see the following:
C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Q2. Use the command git status again and explain what has changed?
A2. We see the following:
C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

This means that we have added the created file README.md inside the git.
        
Q3. What is the output of the command? What is the current status? Now add the README.md to the staging area.
A3. We see the following:
C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git diff README.md
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index e69de29..0fc301b 100644

C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Q4. What can be a good message for the first commit? What is the current
status?
A4. We use the following message and the current status is the following:
C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git commit -m "readme updated"
[main 069a4ee] readme updated
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md

C:\Users\ayesh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\newgit\UPF-POO21-G101-14>git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Q5. How many commits there are in the log? What are the first seven digits
(letters and numbers) that identify the first README.md commit?
A5. There are a lot of commits since we had problems and had to delete and create again the README.me file.
The last seven digits for the first README.md commit are: commit 069a4ee.

Q6. Modify one line of the README.md, add to the staging area and
commit. Then use the command git show HEAD, and explain the output.
A6. The output after git show HEAD is the track of the commits done. The most recent one shows the difference
made in the README.md, that is the previous version and the actual version (after modifying).

Q7. Rewrite the sentence you restored with the previous command. After
that, add the README.md to the staging area. Then, run a reset in the
README.md and explain what happens.
A7. We put git reset 7a3fc12 which corresponds to the last commit done and run the reset. We return to the
README.md file and it has the sentence modified.
